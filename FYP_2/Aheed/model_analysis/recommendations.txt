# Model Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Low Performance
**Issue**: Model accuracy is below 60%

**Recommendation**: Consider more advanced architectures, better feature extraction, or ensemble methods

## General Recommendations

1. **Data Augmentation**: Implement more advanced EEG-specific augmentation techniques
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract more informative features from raw EEG data
3. **Cross-Subject Adaptation**: Improve domain adaptation techniques for better cross-subject generalization
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically optimize hyperparameters
6. **Advanced Architectures**: Explore state-of-the-art architectures like Graph Neural Networks for EEG
